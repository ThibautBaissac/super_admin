# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# This dummy app uses importmap (not Sprockets), so the old config.assets
# configuration is not available in Rails 8.1+
# If you need to add assets configuration, use the appropriate importmap or
# propshaft configuration instead.

# Version of your assets, change this if you want to expire all your assets.
# Rails.application.config.assets.version = "1.0"

# Add additional assets to the asset load path.
# Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Emoji.images_path
